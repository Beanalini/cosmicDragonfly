  ## Description

  The motivation behind this project is to create an application that can be used to write and save notes.

  The Note Taker application developed in this project uses Express JS back-end and  a JSON file to provide data persistence.  The main development aim of this project was to build the back-end, link to the [front-end](#credits), connect the two and deploy the application to Heruko.
